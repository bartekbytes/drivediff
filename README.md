# drivediff

**Compare drives. Find missing files. Sync smarter.**

`drivediff` is a simple, friendly tool to help you detect differences between folders on two drives — like USB sticks, external hard drives, or backup directories.

Whether you're syncing photos, videos, or documents, `drivediff` shows you:

- What's missing on either side
- Which files differ in size or content
- What's already perfectly in sync

---

## ✅ Why use drivediff?

- No tech jargon
- No risky syncing — just a clear report
- Works on local folders, external drives, USB sticks
- Fast & lightweight (written in Rust 🦀)

## 🚀 Example usage

drive-diff /media/user/HDD-1 /media/user/HDD-2
```

Outputs a list of:

- Missing folders/files
